# guncat

Guncat (Gpg UNencrypting CAT) was designed to tackle a problem encountered
with (partially) PGP encrypted files (which may be encountered in, e.g.,
mailboxes).  

Guncat's repository has moved to https://gitlab.com/fbb-git/guncat 
and is not maintained at this location anymore.

The project's web-page can be found at http://fbb-git.gitlab.io/guncat/
