# guncat

Guncat (Gpg UNencrypting CAT) was designed to tackle a problem encountered
with (partially) PGP encrypted files (which may be encountered in, e.g.,
mailboxes).  Tools to process text-files (like grep(1), or less(1)) may be
used to process those files, but standard tools like cat(1) leave PGP
encrypted sections within such files as-is. As a consequence, browsing the
`real' contents (i.e., clear-text sections and the unencrypted contents of PGP
encrypted sections) of those files is difficult.

Guncat  acts like cat, but unencrypts encrypted sections encountered in
the files processed by guncat, copying the unencrypted  information  to
guncat's  standard  output  stream, which may thereupon be processed by
other tools.


To create the program from its sources, either descend into the guncat
directory, or unpack a created archive, cd into its top-level directory 
and follow the instructions provided in the INSTALL file found there.

Alternatively, binary ready-to-install versions of the guncat program are
available in verious Linux distributions, in particular Debian. See, e.g.,
https://packages.debian.org/search?keywords=guncat&searchon=names&suite=all&section=all
