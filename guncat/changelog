guncat (1.01.00)    ********* ISN ***********

  * Added 'build uninstall'. This command only works if, when calling one of
    the 'build install' alternatives and when calling 'build uninstall' the
    environment variable GUNCAT contains the (preferably absolute) filename of
    a file on which installed files and directories are logged. 
    Note that 'build (dist)clean' does not remove the file pointed at by the
    GUNCAT environment variable, unless that file happpens to be in a
    directory removed by 'build (dist)clean'.
    Defining the GUNCAT environment variable as ~/.guncat usually works well.

guncat (0.92.00)

  * The GPG passphrase is now requested only once. It is only requested again
    if a provided passphrase was incorrect.
