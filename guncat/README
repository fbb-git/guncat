Guncat was designed to tackle a problem encountered with (partically) PGP
encrypted files (as encountered, e.g., in mailboxes): the encrypted sections
of such files are relatively difficult to browse through.

Guncat acts like unix's cat command, but handles (partially) encrypted sections
of processed files. Sections of guncat's input files which are surrounded by
    -----BEGIN PGP MESSAGE-----
and
    -----END PGP MESSAGE-----
markers are decrypted before being concatenated to the std. output stream.

Guncat's output (i.e., the standard output stream) may subsequently be processed
by other programs, like grep or less.
